# Pokedex

This project was created as a small school project using the [Pok√©API](https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2). A lot of the originals functionality are missing as the API doesn't allow for advanced queries and I recently updated the project to use react-query with pagination instead of quering all of the pokemons.

## Tech Stack

React, Next.JS, TailwindCSS, Typescript, react-query, Prisma, Next-Auth
